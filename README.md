# Tokenomics Simulator Agent

A **Tokenomics Simulator Agent** tailored for the Solana Hackathon. This project leverages cutting-edge tools, SDKs, and sponsor features to provide users with an interactive and insightful platform for modeling and simulating tokenomics scenarios.

---

## Core Features

1. **Simulation Engine**:
   - Models token supply, staking rewards, inflation, and deflation scenarios.
   - Integrates real-time data feeds via **Switchboard Oracles** for token prices, staking ratios, and other market metrics.

2. **AI-Driven Insights**:
   - Predicts token price, adoption curves, and liquidity behavior using machine learning.
   - Utilizes **Kuzco’s distributed GPU cluster** for efficient on-chain AI inference.

3. **DeFi Integrations**:
   - Supports token swapping, staking, and liquidity pool creation using **Jupiter** and **Meteora**.
   - Enables LP positions and dynamically simulates fee yields with **Orca’s Whirlpools**.

4. **Interactive User Interface**:
   - Sleek ReactJS-based UI offering:
     - Parameter input (e.g., inflation rate, supply).
     - Real-time data visualization (e.g., supply curves, staking APYs).
   - Data visualizations using **D3.js** or **Chart.js**.

5. **Agent Wallet and Transactions**:
   - Uses **Crossmint Wallet APIs** to create gasless wallets for users.
   - Allows agents to perform on-chain actions like token swaps, staking, and payments seamlessly.

6. **Economic Modeling**:
   - Predicts outcomes of tokenomics models, such as DAO treasury growth and community participation.
   - Integrates data processing pipelines for risk scoring using **MetaOra**.
